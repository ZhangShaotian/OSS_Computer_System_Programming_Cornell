# Topic 1: Introduction to C
## 1. Statements, Syntax, Semantics, State  
Statements: The smallest element of programming language that carries out some actions.  
Syntax: The rules that define the structure of a language.  
Semantics: The meaning of the words.  
State: The stored information of a program at sometime.

## 2. Variables, Literals, Operators, Expressions  
Variable is a box in the computer's memory which stores a value.  
Literal is a value written exactly as it is meant to be interpreted.  
Operator is a symbol with special semantics to operate on variables.  
Expression is a combination of variables and literals and operators.  

## 3. Blocks and Scope  
Block is a compound statement, critical for defining functions.  
Scope  of a variable is the region of code where it is accessible.

## 4. Functions  
4.1. Function Definition  
return type, function name, function body, function parameters.  
4.2. Function Call  
Stack frame is a data structure containing function's parameters, local variables and return addresses.

## 5. Conditional Statements  
Conditional Statements make program able to make decisions based on the value of variables.  
5.1. Boolean Operators  
5.2. if/else Conditional Statements  
5.3. Iteration Statements(for loops)
